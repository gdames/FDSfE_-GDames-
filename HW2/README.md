        "#  Do Workforce Readiness Programs Lead to Higher Employment Rates?: Examining the Effectiveness of Delaware's Pathways to Apprenticeship Program   \n",
        " Investigrative study on Delaware Pathways to Apprenticeship (P2A) from 2019-2021. In these years the program which focuses on the industrial trades has had 100 participants in the New Castle County region.\n",
        "\n",
        "** gdames@udel.edu ** (not shared)\n",
        "### General Idea: \n",
        "In examining the effectiveness of workforce readiness programs, we look at the mission statement, program design, course curriculum, recruitment pracitices, and staff and participant backgrounds to determine whether the program was successful in transitioning participants to a paid apprenticeship in their desired trade.\n",
        "### Alternative Hypothesis:\n",
        "After 6-weeks in the Delaware’s Pathways to Apprenticeship workforce readiness program, 65-100% of program participants transitioned to a paid apprenticeship in their desired trade following completion of the program. \n",
        "### Null Hypothesis: \n",
        "After 6-weeks in the Delaware’s Pathways to Apprenticeship workforce readiness program, 0-50% of program participants transitioned to a paid apprenticeship in their desired trade following completion of the program. \n",
        "### Comments on experimental design:\n",
        "- Apprenticeship needs to be defined. \n",
        "- Obstacles unique to the participant must be identified.\n",
        "- Financial assistance during the program is necessary. \n",
        "- Successful completion of the program for each participant must be specified. \n",
        "- Key determinants of success must be identified. \n",
        "- Relation of apprenticeship to employability needs to described. \n",
